\label{sec:results}

Here below a brief enumeration of the achieved results during this project.
\\
\\
a) A designed and implemented mathematical model to detect geospatial-temporal commuting patterns.
\\
\\
b) A set of charts and maps which illustrates the previous model, making it easier to deduce interesting findings.
\\
\\
c) An on-line application\footnote{"Poner la dirección de las herramientas"} to display all this information in a friendly and customizable way.
\\
\\
Now, let's have a more detailed view of them, as well as other partial findings.
\\
\\
According to the proposed model, a very important feature has been deduced for the Commuting Dynamics. As seen in the picture below, there are two time zones where people perform more phone calls from their handsets than usual. Static and dynamic users have not been distinguished, that is, both self-edges and transition edges are counted together.

\end{figure}


%There are two peaks, $p_1$, from 7:00 am to 9:00 am, and another one, $p_2$, from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm. As it can be seen, the 'morning-peak' is lower than the 'evening-peak'. Moreover, both peaks reach their maximum value at the end of their corresponding time zones, i.e., $p_1$ at 9:30 am and $p_2$ at 7:30 pm. Note how the amount of calls increases linearly since 5 am and how it decreases linearly too since 8:00 pm. Another remarkable feature is the existence of a central valley between $p_1$ and $p_2$, that is, from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm. This 'peak-valley-peak' pattern is shown for all days in the week, so that it can be assumed that people have the same behaviour (at least, according to our target datasets).
\\
\\
Let's extract some ideas from the previous chart, focusing on what commuters could be probably doing (as it will be seen shortly, most of the phone calls belong to 'dynamic users'): they get up early in the morning and start to perform more and more phone calls from their handsets until $p1_$; next, the amount of phone calls decreases slightly, keeping itself more or less balanced (workhours, lunch) until the beginning of $p2_$; later, people leave the office and plan the rest of the day (errands, leisure...), what is reflected on a marked rise in the amount of phone calls.
\\
\\
Since it is really complicated to measure the displacements of the people (antenna locations instead of users locations, missing antena identifiers...), what will be analyzed is the amount of callers who are really commuters, that is, dynamic users. This one will be the essential magnitude of our research, leading us to figure out the Commuting Dynamics key-features for different regions and times. Eventually, all conclusions deduced from the G/T Model (charts, formulae...) will be ultimately tested with the final GIS visualization as the main core of the work. In this last phase, geographical displacements are estimated so that they can be plotted in a dynamic and interactive map which makes it easier to detect peaks and trends.
\\
\\
With this new chart, it is the ratio between commuters and all users what it is being emphasized. During a particular day (24h), there is no need to know if a concrete displacement is or not longer than other. What it is being highlighted here is the movement detection itself, in 1h windows which group all users calling within them. The color of the chart shows how many users are really commuters.
\\
\\
Datasets have been processed according to the proposed G/T Model, filtering non-commuters when commuters tracks have been calculated. Below, seven charts display Commuting Dynamics for each week-day.
As shown in the results, there is no correlation between the number of dynamic users and the maximum displacement peaks, actually, at the same time the number of dynamic users are growing, the central valley and the two maximum commuting peaks are always presented in the sample.
\\
\\
These seven charts below show a fitter correlation with the theoretical commuting model proposed in this paper (Figure ~\ref{fig:commuting}), displaying two high peaks and a lower central valley. However, more qualitative data is necessary to figure out the performance of the first high peak, because it is not related to the number of dynamic users. Furthermore, a first approach can be applied to comment that few dynamic users (in comparision with the mean) travel longer distances in this first peak, specially in  the first uphill to the first peak. This is a common pattern figured out from the proposed model. However, it can be explained because there are people starting their journey from further distances early in the morning, since the most of the people live near their work places and travel shorter distances than the first group.

Density analysis takes known quantities of some phenomena and spreads them across the landscape based on the quantity that is measured at each location and the spatial relationship of the locations of the measured quantities. From the position of the antennas of mobile telephony and the weight estimated for each of them, depending on their traffic intensity, a kernel function has been used to calculate the density of features in a neighborhood around those features. It calculates a magnitude per unit area from point features (antennas) using a kernel function to fit a smoothly tapered surface to each point. The result is a surface, a raster image. The original information of the antenna positions was expressed in geographical spherical coordinates (longitude, latitude), but the kernel functions needs to work with  projected information to calculate the distances, therefore a previous conversion of the same ones was performed projecting them to a projection system UTM using the datum WGS84 and the zone 30N.
\\
\\
Kernel Density calculates the density of point features around each output raster cell; the kernel function is based on the quadratic kernel function described in Silverman, 1986. Conceptually, a smoothly curved surface is fitted over each point. The surface value is highest at the location of the point and diminishes with increasing distance from the point, reaching zero at the ‘search radius’ distance from the point. Only a circular neighborhood is possible. The volume under the surface equals the ‘population field’ value for the point. The density at each output raster cell is calculated by adding the values of all the kernel surfaces where they overlay the raster cell center. The cells nearer the measured points, the antennas' weight, receive higher proportions of the measured quantity than those farther away. (ESRI©, 2012).

A visualization of the displacement with a Kernel Density estimation using GIS with the antenna positions and users displacements like a directed graph has shown the contraction and the expansion of the commuting dynamics across the 24 hours of the day. The first expansion visualization through the kernel density estimation is clearly showed when peak $p_1$ starts to grow between $[5:00,7:00]$ reaching the central valley at $8$.

Also, while a normalized displacement meassure is distributed across the country in the valley hours, a reduction of the displacement of the dynamic users can be appreciated especially on roads where KDE had a high intensity. In the picture above,  Monday 06:00, shows cleary a high intensity kernel distributions, coinciding with the maximum displacement moment calculated and showed in Figure~\ref{fig:dynamic_displacements} on Monday. These values should be identified independently each week day. Commuting displacement distribution, however, the ranges of peaks $p_1, p_2$ and the central valley are leading to a regular temporal pattern.
\\
\\
Next pictures show in a more detailed way the reduction on the KDE on the roads between main cities. We have selected a sample zone in order to show the correlation between the numerical distance calculated by means of the proposed mathematical model in Section~\ref{sec:math_model} and the KDE calculated by means of GIS technology, to test the final aim proposed in this study.

Therefore, the pictures above show the evolution of KDE in the focus location when maximum displacement $p_1$ is reached at 06:00, after this hour, KDE becomes softer at 07:00 and 08:00 starting the central valley. Through KDE  we can figure out that the median displacement in the central valley 08:00 and continues until $p_2$ has a greater value as numerical results leads.
\\
\\
The central valley has a uniform distribution of KDE and we can also observe in the next picture how the intensity increases when peak $p_2$ is reached. We propose the same location to explore and correlate the numerical results of $p_2$ with the final visualization of the dynamics taking into account the two variables.
