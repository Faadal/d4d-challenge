\subsection{Final Conclusions}

Several algorithms have been implemented and tested. We observe that there are some main parameters which can be identified, like $\rho$ in order to enhance exploration or to enhance exploitation. Moreover, several approaches have been studied in a real problem through a labeled graph map.

We provide our source code\footnote{https://github.com/yarox/alos} in order to allow researchers and students to check our results and experiment with this algorithms.
