\section{Introduction}
Our aim and final goal in this project is to detect spatio-temporal patterns in order to obtain an usefull knowledge to manage better the country resources. As example, if we can predict the intensity of traffic segemented by road, day of the week and hour, could be suggested anothers secondary roads or invest into improve the most used ones.
\\
In this paper is proposed a space-temporal model in order to achieve this goal. A space model because user interactions or dynamics with geolocate antennas are analized and treated, and a temporal model because several time windows are used to group this user dynamics. Later, the mix of this two variables (space and temporal) are consumed and visualized by a Geographic Information System.
\\
\\
The aim comes to the Commuting concept and could be defined as follow: \emph{Commuting} is regular travel between one's place of residence and place of work or full-time study \citep{wiki:commuting}, but  sometimes its refers to \emph{any regular or often repeated traveling between locations when not work related}. Our first commuting approach is defined like: "Mobility patterns through infering dynamic users movements grouped by temporal windows". 
\\
A dynamic user is defined like an user that change his antenna position into the studied temporal window (i.e.: each temporal window group the whole user communication into one specific hour). Between this temporal windows static users habe been removed, i.e.: users that does not change its antennas positions into the temporal range. The justification to remove this users comes to focus our study in users that are moving into this temporal windows and perform micro-displacements.
